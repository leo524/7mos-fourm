# Custom Static pages for NodeBB

Allows you to add as many new pages as you like to your NodeBB forum. New routes get added to the header automatically. Each new page has four widget areas (header, footer, content, and sidebar) which you can use to add HTML to in the Widgets ACP.

After creating or removing a new route, you have to restart NodeBB in order for the route to be registered.

## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-custom-pages

## TODO

* Being able to move around the routes in the header, this will be done in core first (see [this issue](https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/issues/1481)). Right now, the routes will show up in the menu based on when you defined them.

* Move all widgets to draft zone if you delete a static page
